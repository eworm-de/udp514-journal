Requirements
------------

To compile and run `udp514-journal` you need:

* [systemd ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://www.github.com/systemd/systemd)
* [markdown ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (HTML documentation)

Build and install
-----------------

Building and installing is very easy. Just run:

    make

followed by:

    make install

This will place an executable at `/usr/bin/udp514-journal`,
documentation can be found in `/usr/share/doc/udp514-journal/`.
Additionally systemd unit files `udp514-journal.service` and
`udp514-journal.socket` are installed to
`/usr/lib/systemd/system/`.

Usage
-----

Just run `udp514-journal` or start a systemd unit with:

    systemctl start udp514-journal.socket

Make sure UDP port 514 is not blocked in your firewall.

To enable it permanently to make it start on system boot run:

    systemctl enable --now udp514-journal.socket

Use `journalctl` to view the logs:

    $ journalctl -u udp514-journal
